## A warm welcome to Arseniy Poroshin's page 💙

I am a quantitative developer, striving to be great at both engineering and trading, and a very curious person.

### What do you do professionally?

- 📈 I am supplementing the quants with tech expertise to get up and running.
- 🎱 I have completed many projects in QD, as well as backend engineering, software infrastructure.
- 🐍 I mostly write in Python with scientific batteries.
- 🤸🏻‍♂️ I appreciate the concepts underpinning other languages like C, C++, Go, Rust.
- 👀 Currently I am learning the ecosystem of tools and utils made by GNU, Apache, Amazon and others.

### What is it that you care about?

- 🧑‍🌾 I would love our society to put more into the research for defeating human ageing. No, it hardly affects overpopulation. No, boredom is a separate issue as well. Let us defeat aging! [A good summarizing talk by Andrew Steele](https://youtu.be/fX9P1xuIJGg)
- 🎲 I love the probability theory. For example, when considering a distribution of outcomes, pay attention to how catastrophic the worst cases are. Here is a little primer on how to not over-bet on a seemingly positive expected return: [the Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion)
- 📈 I am a trading & finance hobbyist. A Quantitative analysis alumnus at [CMF](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cmf-ynvrsty/).
- あ I love learning languages. Learning new sounds, new alphabets, and new ways of how grammar can work is so much fun to me!
- 🏞 I love hiking. What could be better than a lovely journey passing by a mountain river at a 2,000 m altitude in warm weather?
- 🚴‍♂️ Cycling, trams and trains / Make a lively place!
- 🕊 I am a fan of peace and liberty. Many times have I seen the neighbours enjoying living together. Let us nourish love to each other!
